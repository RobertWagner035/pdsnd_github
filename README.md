### Project Title
Robert's bikeshare project

### Description
The project created a python file, that deals with bikeshare data from three different cities in the US: Chicago, New York City and Washington.
Starting the python code in the terminal leads to an interaction with the user, who can first decide if he wants to see some raw data.
After checking the raw data, the user can ask the program to see statistical data, depending on city, month and weekday.
Depending on the input by the user, the code calculates and shows different statistics on bikesharing.   

### Files used
Bikeshare data for Chicago: chicago.csv
Bikeshare data for New York: new_york_city.csv
Bikeshare data for Washington: washington.csv
Python code: robert_bikeshare_project.py
